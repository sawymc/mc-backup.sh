## This is a fork
I forked this to create a script that makes backups and stores them in a GitHub repository (preferably a private one). The original script focuses on making local backups and is quite awesome. I encourage you to check the OG version first and use this only if your usecase incorporates git.

Also, the original script has extensive README, so go check that out. I didn't copy that, because things from it don't apply here.
